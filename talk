SLIDE: Introduction, name email, url

Hello. My name is tef and I would like to talk to you about computer security, especially web applications, I've worked as a security consultant and I've been interested in hacking from a young age.

SLIDE: Blank

Now I have introduced myself I would like to know a little bit more about the audience. Could you please raise your hand if:

-- had a virus on your computer/mobile phone
-- had an account or a password stolen
-- used a site that has been hacked - myspace, phpbb, wordpress
-- been hacked ?
   your own code or someone elses?

Hopefully you can see from this small (biased unrepresentative) sample that nearly everyone has been affected by computer security at one point in their lives, but many people when writing a website think "It'll never happen to me".

It does. Personally I've found major bugs in popular websites such as b3ta and livejournal, but major web applications such as myspace, phpbb, drupal have had their share of problems too.

No-one is immune, and if you have bugs people will find them and exploit them.

I don't intend to scare you, I aim to show you how to deal with these problems realistically.


To begin, I'd like to tell you what security is all about and why it is important:

SLIDE: Big letters: Money

If you can't keep your users trust, you will lose their business.

Information such as emails, passwords and a large audience make you
a target.

SLIDE: Infection numbers for wordpress/phpbb worm, overall incident numbers
Source: Sans/ISC

If you use off the shelf software that's popular you are more at risk. PHPBB and wordpress are prime examples.

Sometimes worms find their next victims by google. You might regret that SEO.

Running buggy software isn't the biggest risk. By far, humans are much buggier.

In the name of security, wikipedia published lists of possible troll accounts as they had identified that trolls often use the same password on multiple accounts.

Trolls didn't pick secure passwords but used obvious ones, but so did a lot of innocent wikipedia users. The staff had just handed to the trolls a list of accounts for which their password would work.


People make mistakes when writing code too:

SLIDE: Exploit numbers for the phpbb, bind, sendmail
Soure: Secunia
    phpbb, bind, sendmail, 

Threat Models - Realistic considerations of security aka What's your threat model, how attackers think

What's your threat model? 
the four most important words in security.

To be able to prepare and test for problems you need to think about what you're defending against. A good start is to break down the likely attackers:

Slide: Trolls/Opportunistic Hackers/ Automated Exploits 

Common Threats - OWASP and Sans top 10
XSS and SQL injections - what they are and how they are easily prevented
Testing - a plan and tools avaliable
Wrap up - some fun bugs and hacks I couldn't fit in elsewhere, Q&A
